<p>Hey there!
<br>
    My name is Ash Cochran. Over the years I've have developed a love for photography and capturing images. 
    I have always been drawn to the beauty of nature as well as human interactions. Where nature and the aesthetic of the outdoors is beautiful it never beats working with individuals to capture the moments that mean the most to the. This includes weddings, birthdays, even photos when they feel at peace or maybe a portrait for an important position. No matter the occasion, I love being able to capture it, allowing for my clients to have that memory with them always.</p>

<h4>My Experiance</h4>
<p>
    Despite my love for photography and hours of practice in my own time, I would be where I am without the assistance of my numerous teachers and courses over the years.

The classes I have taken Include:
</p>

<ul>
    <li>Grade 10 Media Arts at Earl of March High School</li>
    <li>Grade 11 & 12 Photography at Earl of March High School</li>
    <li>nd a term long Photography Course at Algonquin Collage</li>
</ul>

<p>As well as guided learning, working with clients and friends over 
    the past 3 to 4 years as a freelance photographer has given me the experience to capture any moment, idea, or occasion a client is 
    looking for. </p>
