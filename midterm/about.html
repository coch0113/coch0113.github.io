                <p>is ARC? We are the Athletics & Recreation Centre. This is an exciting venture for our Algonquin Community.  This facility will provide our students with a place to break through perceptual barriers in a welcoming, safe, inclusive and inviting environment for students of all backgrounds, cultures and abilities to spark a movement.</p>
                <h2>What</h2>
                <p>is this going to cost me? This facility will be included in your activity fee. All fee-paying students can use and participate in all activities in the building. As for the facility, it will cost Algonquin College $48.8 million.</p>
                <h2>Where</h2>
                <p>will the ARC building be? The ARC building will be located northeast of the Student Commons building, opposite of the residence. The facility will be an estimated 100,000 square feet! Connected to the Student Commons by a "Plus 15" Pedestrian Link. </p>

            <p>will have full service throughout the day. Why not come in after a long day of class and order one of our famous poutines. Finished with your food and drink? Why not try out the new billiards area. Grab some friends and dominate them in some pool. Pool, not your thing? Then come on downstairs and try out the new bowling lanes! </p>
